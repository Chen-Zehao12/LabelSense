## TL;DR

LabelSense is a versatile `plug-and-play` method that can be added to any encoder to enhance classification performance by having an awareness of label context.

## Abstract

Text classification presents a fundamental challenge in information systems, necessitating efficient strategies to accurately categorize textual data. Conventionally, labels in this context are usually treated as numerical identifiers, overlooking the intricate semantic nuances associated with human decision-making in multiple-choice scenarios. Effective decision-making involves not only understanding the problem at hand but also considering the semantic context of each available option. Prior research in label semantics has shown promise, yet often fell short in providing clear and comprehensive label contextualization. To address this gap, we present LabelSense, a versatile "plug-and-play" approach that augments labels with rich explanations and illustrative examples, achieving robust label contextualization and enhanced label semantics. By leveraging centroid-based learning and contrastive learning techniques, our methodology significantly advances text classification performance across diverse datasets. We evaluate our approach on various datasets, with a particular focus on the legal dataset and the multi-label text classification dataset. The results showcase a remarkable enhancement of over 10 percentage points in Precision@1 compared to the baseline model, highlighting the effectiveness of our LabelSense methodology.

## Usage

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

Create a new environment `LabelSense` using conda

```bash
conda create -n LabelSense python=3.11
```

Activate `LabelSense` environment

```bash
conda activate LabelSense
```

Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üìñ Dataset

The datasets used in this paper include:

* Multi-class Dataset
  * 20 Newsgroups
  * Blurb Genre Collection (BGC)
  * Web of Science (WOS)
* Multi-label Dataset
  * RCV1-v2
  * Reuters-21578
  * AAPD
  * freecode
  * EUR-Lex

You can download using `data/download.sh`

First you need to change your directory to `data`:

```bash
cd data
```

And download dataset using:

```bash
bash download.sh <Dataset Name>
```

For example, if you want to download `RCV1-v2`:

```bash
bash download.sh RCV1-v2
```

Of course, you can also download all datasets at once:

```bash
bash download.sh all
```

The downloaded dataset is placed in the `origin` folder of the `data/<Dataset Name>` folder

### üîß Preprocess

Go to the directory `data/<Dataset Name>` and there is a `preprocess.ipynb`.

By running this jupyter notebook will get the preprocessed files  `id2label.json`, `label2id.json`, `train.json`, `train-with-example.json`, `test.json`, `test-with-example.json`

### üéØ To Run

Modify the parameters in the `run.sh` file

And run in the project `root` directory:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

The result will be placed in the `output_dir` folder
